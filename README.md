# Hang in There  

### Abstract:

I built a little fake-out application - with its buttons, it's able to go to and from "pages" by simply hiding certain views, while allowing a user to view the desired one that was picked, via its button. 
In this app, you are also able to perfrom certain functions based on what each view is built for - a user can circulate through random posters, can save one if they would like, can build their own posters, and save those if desired as well. Users are able to view posters that are saved (duplicates will not appear). There is also a section for unmotivational posters, which can be deleted with a double click, if that's not your kind of thing. 


### Installation Instructions:

Good question -
- git clone this repo
- In your terminal, navigate to the project repo
-  Run the command `open index.html`


### Preview of App:

I don't know how to gif, but I think this features the ability to create your own poster nicely. My personal favorite piece.
### Context:

I had 1.5 weeks I believe to complete this project. It was assigned the first day of mod2.

### Learning Goals:

I believe the learning goals were to learn how to better work with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Those were the three components that make up the application for this project. 

### Wins + Challenges:

The first win will be completing this project - even if it's not 100% perfect, I'm very proud to have gotten it done and to have a final product to show for it. The other win is whatever I did manage to learn from doing this project. I'm definitley not an expert at HTML, CSS, or Javascript, but I can say I have a better understanding of the three now. 
The entire project in itself was a huge challenge for me. This language has been very hard for me to comprehend, so there were a lot of tears that went into this project and getting through it. I reached out to whoever I could when I was really needing help, which is how I got through this project. I probably could not have done it completely on my own, with no resources.
